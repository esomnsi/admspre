						Tool suffices the need to cater solutioning based on  varied inputs as received from RFP / Customer where in the need is to branch out and create different methods. The model will consider client's volumetric stack, client's people stack and details of client's IT spending (in the form of CAPEX and OPEX details) as three separate dimensions. All of these could be mutually inclusive to each other.

                    <p>
                    	Tool enabled with extensive reporting and dashboard mechanism which allow users to slice and dice data and generate graphical views dynamically for the selected scope of services. With varied type of reports like FTE summary view, Cost summary view, Report describing percentage of contribution on different cost component, Summary and detailed staffing/ramp up, pyramid summary, deal comparison report

    	<div class="banner_costRateIcon tooltipBanner"><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>
						Model as an analytics to better understand Loaded Cost Rate trend for Delivery and Solution optimization for similar type of opportunities or opportunities triggering out of same geographies or client profile. This feature will also help Win-Loss analysis process to effectively utilize the "Lessons Learnt" from one Solution to the other.

        <div class="banner_designAndPlaningIcon tooltipBanner"><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>
						Tool enables transformation design & planning , the ramp up plan would be created which would consider the application alignment along with optimization of cost. Transformation Design and Planning section will derive ideally derive input from Application Portfolio Analysis and will apply portfolio level complexity to generate application transformation plan.

    <div class="banner_historyAndPortfolioPanel">
    	<div class="banner_historyIcon tooltipBanner"><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>
						Tool enables the historical analysis of parameters considered for similar kind of Solution profiling done earlier so to optimize the offer as required. A versioning system where each iteration from creation to the approval / rejection would have to be stored and time stamped with a single view window of all the versions with associated owners.

        <div class="banner_portfolioIcon tooltipBanner"><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>
						Model to enable analyzing the client's AS-IS application portfolio using current scope, volumetric, application complexity factors. Output put will Application Portfolio Balanced Score Card. This section will also provide necessary commentary during the journey. Application portfolio analysis forms the basis of any solution.  The analysis augments the solution with the basis of Application risk and complexity.
