1 =  *  Operations & Support service activities, processes defined in Support Solution section are as per Ericsson\u2019s experience on Support Projects. Ways of Working, Processes, reports, activities for TeliaSonera CEM Operation and Support will be adapted, detailed down and signed off during by the close of steady stage phase after Knowledge Transfer for GSI.
2 =  *  Single instance of the solution will be supported. Support will be provided for Production instance of the server.
3 =  *  In the absence of volumetric intelligence, the FTE size may undergo changes depending on changes in assumptions, input data or solution refining. We will revalidate all solution assumptions during stabilization period (first 4 weeks of steady state) post KT.
4 =  *  Region will ensure the Knowledge Transfer from existing SI team (Including 3PP if any).
5 =  *  Region need to ensure timely inputs & support is available from 3PP or PDU as required during the course of engagement for development and Support work in scope. If there is any schedule delay due to delay in inputs from 3PP or PDU will not fall in GSI responsibility. GSI will ensure timely escalation to Region team in absence to response within agreed SLAs from 3PP.
6 =  *  Region will drive and govern the SLAs with 3PP or PDU.
7 =  *  It is assumed manpower will be deployed by Region for Level 1 support and any other support required which is not outlined in GSI scope for example for any production deployments, Infrastructure Management services which requires \u2018hands & feet support\u2019 and coordination with 3PPs and Data Center personnel. 
8 =  *  SLA ownership will commence post 4 weeks of operations stability i.e. from October\u201914 onwards.
9 =  *  GSCI Level 2 and Level 3 services will be provided on a \u2018Reactive Mode\u2019 only. This means that GSI support personnel will commence services only upon receipt of a request through e-mail (mandatory during out-of-office hours, India Time) and the ticketing tool for performing resolution around the identified scope of components. Any proactive monitoring/ trouble-shooting is not considered as part of services.
10 =  *  Tools, HW/SW, & licenses are considered to be provided by Region. GSCI Development, Support and Maintenance personnel will be accessing implemented tools proposed by the Region/Customer. 
11 =  *  Access to existing documentation and knowledge repositories to be granted to GSCI staff prior to commencement of knowledge transfer.
12 =  *  Acceptance criteria of deliverables need to be mutually agreed upon between GSI, Region and TeliaSonera (as appropriate). 
13 =  *  GSI will use environments provided by Region for Development, Test, & UAT for Level3 & ADM activities. 
14 =  *  In case the connectivity and/or application access is not established by end of Operation readiness, the Region needs to take additional responsibility.
15 =  *  In order that engagement timelines are adhered to, and there is no deviation in Transition timelines & costs, it is essential that Connectivity Solution is in place by service commencement. Failure to go live with connectivity solution will result in extension of Transition period (that is, overrun of the cost of Transition to be borne by the Region), hence detrimental to the overall business case and commercials. This is a major dependency of the proposed solution
16 =  *  Region will ensure availability of key internal / vendor resources during the engagement for knowledge acquisition and ongoing reporting and issue resolution
17 =  *  Region will have to facilitate Knowledge Transfer from incumbent team and business user teams on the business processes followed around existing applications before the services can be taken over by EGI 
18 =  *  Baseline Source Code and Software development Licenses will be provided GSI during transition period.
19 =  *  Complete baseline solution documentation will be handed over to EGI during transition. Region to ensure existing team is providing full support during transition.
20 =  *  Pre-Production system should be made available by Region/Customer to EGI in order to investigate the production defects. Customer/Region to provide necessary support to sync the pre-production system as and when needed. 
21 =  *  It is assumed that all communication (written or verbal) with EGI staff will be in English. 
22 =  *  Seating, telephonic calls (local and STD) and Infrastructure support for EGI onsite resources (if necessary) will be arranged by region at no extra cost to EGI.
23 =  *  It will be the responsibility of Region to provide onsite Service Management Layer (over and above operations layer) to ensure right governance, contract management with TeliaSonera and 3PPs. 
24 =  *  Region will have to provide sufficient period of time for EGI to arrange of the resource ramp-up and ramp-down in case of demand increase/decrease. A ramp-up period of up to 8 to 12 weeks is required while a ramp-down notice of 4 weeks is required.
25 =  *  The EGI support team will comprise of a relevant mix of domain and technical experts, based on our understanding of requirements. However, if during the course of engagement, it is evident that the mix needs to be modified, EGI will make necessary changes to the staffing plan in consultation with Region  - and any resulting change in  additional commercials will need to be borne by the Region
26 =  *  Region/Customer to provide snap shot of the production environment for development environment to fix and replicate the defects.
27 =  *  It is necessary that Region facilitates the appropriate network id\u2019s for commencement of services. Any delay in providing the same, will cause delay in commencing services.
28 =  *  The support service engagement timelines are dependent on the timelines of the SI/implementation project. Any deviations in the SI timelines would cause a cascading effect on the support services commencement date. Variation in date of commencement of services will result in modification of charges payable during the year.
29 =  *  In order that engagement timelines are adhered to, and there is no deviation in costs, it is essential that Connectivity Solution to enable remote access is in place prior to commencement of the support engagement. Failure to achieve this will result in extension of service commencement, and inability to conduct operations from offshore hence detrimental to the overall business case and commercials. This is a major dependency of the proposed solution. 
30 =  *  Region will facilitate appropriate Visa\u2019s/ Work-Permits for GSCI personnel, customer availability, so that operations proceed smoothly if and when required.
